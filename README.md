 * Note: It works on macOS only.

## Compatability

Gulp v3 is incompatible with Node v12. As a result if your Gulp and Node versions are equal to the above mentioned ones, you will be unable to successfully run `npm install`.

See [this Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55926692/2694800) for more details

Two workarounds:

+ Upgrade to Gulp 4
+ Downgrade Node to an earlier version
  + The simplest way to do this is with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

## Install

```
ipm install vibrant-dark-ui
```

## How to build

```
npm install
gulp build
```
